             <p class="text">
                The most obvious and potentially most important health benefit of travelling is stress reduction.
                Traveling has the ability to take you out of our daily routine and into new surroundings and experiences
                and this can reset your body and mind.
                Even planning a trip can have a fantastic effect on the body,
                it boosts happiness and feels rewarding. 
                <br/>
                Not only does travel reduce stress but it expands the mind.
                Meeting new people and adapting to new situations makes one more globally and culturally aware. 
                This keeps the mind sharp, increases creativity and helps with personal growth.
                <br/>
                It's obvious that travel comes with a myriad of health benefits for the mind, body and soul, so what are you waiting for? 
                It's time to book that holiday.
                <br/>
                Your health will thank you for it!
